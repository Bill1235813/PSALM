An example planning problem is:
[[context_nl]]

A plan for the example problem is:

Now I have a new planning problem and its description. Can you provide a executable plan, in the way of a sequence of behaviors, to solve the problem?

The new planning problem is:
[[task_nl]]

Please provide the list of actions in the FORMAT as described in the example, i.e., each action must start with "(" and end with ")", with the action name the corresponding parameters in the middle.
Please output a clean, complete list of actions, including the option and the starting actions you choose, to solve the problem.
Don't use the word repeat in the response.
