[[domain_nl]]

The current guess of the preconditions and effects for actions are:
[[action_description]]

Please infer missing or correct wrong [[postfix]] for action [[action]] in CNF, given the PDDL types and predicates:
[[domain_type_pred]]

To help you predict the [[postfix]], we provide a running example in this domain. For the problem:
[[task_nl]]

The initial state of the task in PDDL is:
[[task_init]]

A plan (list of actions) runs in the simulator like:
[[trajectory]]

Please use the information from the simulator output carefully, and output the CNF in a clean format of "(and (...) (...))", where each parentheses contains some predicates.
Note that you should not specify types, e.g., "- object", in preconditions and effects.

The [[postfix]] for [[action]] are:
